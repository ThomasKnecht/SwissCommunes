Description: The mutations of Swiss communes are tracked in a
    machine-readable mutation list.  This allows guessing the
    reference time for any given list of municipality IDs, and to
    construct mappings between two lists of municipality IDs.  The
    package provides functions to import and work with this
    mutation list.
