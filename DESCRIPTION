Description: The mutations of Swiss communes are tracked in a machine-readable
    mutation list.  This allows guessing the reference time for any given list
    of municipality IDs, and to construct mappings between two lists of
    municipality IDs.  The package provides functions to import and work with
    this mutation list.
